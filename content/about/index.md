Hello!! My name is Łukasz, i enjoy learning from data and predicting things from data. I began my journey into [Python](#) and [machine learning](#) in 2017 at University and found my passion. Learning from and predicting our lives using data is a core foundation for improving technology and for self-improvement and i aspire to continue learning and improving my skills so it can reflect in my work.

Fast-forward to today, and I’ve had the privilege of working at a education institution, a technology company, a student driven shop, and a student-led rugby club.


Here is a list of the technologies that I'm familiar with!
