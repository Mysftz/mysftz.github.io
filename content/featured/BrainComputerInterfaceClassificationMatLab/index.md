This projects analyses data from autism patients, witht he dataset containing EEG readings from 7 sessions of each 15 subjects culminating a total of 105 sessions which are trained under a CNN and testing against set data. The aim was to conduct an analysis of how variations of the CNN's settings affect the test accuracy from the number of epochs, layers to layer size, learning rate, layer types and type of classifier. The accuracy of the CNN was improved from 76% to 84% with further analysis showing an improvment up to 86%.
