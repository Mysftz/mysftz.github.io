To further explore artificial intelligent systems within society, a cognitive neural network model that detects a disease in the cassava plant is taken and improved with the test accuracy reaching up to 67%. Through testing, it was proven that the more epochs ran, the better the test accuracy however the limit was beyond the GPU restrictions but could be seen in further development. The hindrances did not allow for the projects goals to be completed however sufficient improvement was made unto the existing model and is set for further development.
