I’m a data scientist with 5+ years of experience using [python](#) and [matlab](#), with a variety of
experience in other coding languages. 

I hold a Masters degree in [Artificial
Intelligence](#) and a Bachelors in [Astronomy, Space Science and Astrophysics](#) holding schloarships in both degrees. I'm
passionate about data science for the reason that data can tell us a lot about how we have
lived, do live and will live.
